# Full Stack School App

This full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database. In addition, the project requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. This project was created for the purpose of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.
